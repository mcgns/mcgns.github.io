## Purposes of processing your personal information
As well as providing individually tailored services for our clients, performed by our volunteers, we engage in other activities that are vital for our successful functioning as an organisation. We may therefore process your personal information for our own legitimate interests provided those interests don’t override yours. We use your personal information for some or all of these:

## Data Protection Principles and Lawful Basis
### Personal data shall be processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner
Our lawful basis under the GDPR for processing your personal data is that it is necessary for our legitimate interests. We can only provide our driving, befriending, shopping and practical help services appropriately, safely and effectively if we process personal information about our clients, volunteers and associated individuals. In circumstances where processing your information does not fall within our legitimate interests, we will seek your consent. In these cases,we make sure your consent is unambiguous, it is given by an affirmative action and it is recorded as the condition for processing.

### Personal data shall be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes
We process personal data for the purpose of providing our services appropriately, safely and effectively, in an individually tailored fashion. We need to be able to communicate with our clients, volunteers and associated individuals, as part of providing our services properly. We won't process personal data for purposes incompatible with the original purpose it was collected for.

### Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which it is processed
We collect personal data necessary for the relevant purposes and ensure it is not excessive. The information we process is necessary for and proportionate to our purposes. Where personal data is provided to us or obtained by us but is not relevant to our stated purposes, we will erase it.

### Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
Where we become aware that personal data is inaccurate or out of date, having regard to the purpose for which it is being processed, we will take every reasonable step to ensure that data is erased or rectified without delay. If we decide not to either erase or rectify it, we will document our decision.

### Personal data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary
We retain your data for six years after you last make contact with us. We keep it for six years so we can (i) ensure continuity of service, or continuity of our relationship, should you contact us during this period, and (ii) deal with legal or insurance claims. We will retain your data for longer than six years if there is an on-going legal claim, or if we are required by law to do so.

### Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage
Hard copy information that is subject to the GDPR is stored in our secure “portable office” with lockable hard-sided cases and a strict process followed by our Duty Officers to ensure maximum security. Electronic information is processed securely with appropriate access controls applied.The systems we use to process personal data allow us to erase or update personal data at any point in time.

## Special Category Data (i.e. sensitive data) and Criminal Offence Data
In order to provide our services appropriately, safely and effectively for both our clients and our volunteers, we process special category data, and as part of our statutory duty we process criminal offence data. 
* The special category data that we process, defined at Article 9 of the GDPR, is data concerning an individual’s health. Our lawful basis for processing this information is legitimate interests. The specific condition for processing this data that applies to us is listed in Article 9(2)(c) as “necessary to protect the vital interests” of the individual. This is because it is essential that we are aware of our clients’ and volunteers’ health needs for our services to be performed appropriately, safely and effectively
* We have legal authority under the Data Protection Act 2018 to process criminal offence data, asit is a requirement to conduct the government’s Disclosure and Barring Service checks for certain categories of our volunteers; namely, Befrienders, Shoppers and Drivers. Our lawful basis for processing this data is legitimate interests as it is vital that we and our clients are confident that our volunteers do not pose a risk to the vulnerable adults they provide services for.

## Your Data Protection Rights
* The GDPR provides certain rights for individuals, which are set out in this Privacy Notice. If you choose to exercise your rights, we may need to verify your identity for security reasons.If we reasonably need more information to help us find your data or identify you, we will ask you for the information we need. In such cases we will need you to respond with this information, or with proof of your identity, before we can comply with your request.
* We Can refuse to comply with your request if we believe that it is what the law calls “manifestly unfounded or excessive”. All of your rights listed below are subject to this. In reaching this decision, we can take into account whether your request is repetitive.In such circumstances we can charge a reasonable fee to deal with your request, or refuse to deal with it.In either case we will tell you and justify your decision. Provided your request is not “manifestly unfounded or excessive” you are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. We have one month to respond to you, although in certain circumstances this timescale can be extended by two months.

### Your right of access
You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. As there are some exemptions, you may not always receive all the information we process. We may refuse your access request if your data includes information about another individual, except where the other individual has agreed to the disclosure, or it is reasonable to provide you with this information without the other individual’s consent. Subject to the proviso above about repetitive requests,you can request access more than once. You are also entitled to be told the following things:

### Your right to restriction of processing
You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information in certain circumstances.You can ask us to temporarily limit the use of your data when we are considering either (i) a challenge you have made to the accuracy of your data, or (ii) an objection you have made to the use of your data.You may also ask us to limit the use of your data rather than delete it if either (a) we have processed your data unlawfully but you do not want it deleted, or (b) we no longer need your data but you want us to keep it in order to create, exercise or defend legal claims. We will take appropriate steps to restrict the use of your data,including, if relevant:

We can also refuse if the processing of your data is for a legal claim.We will inform you of our decision and why.

### Your right to data portability
This only applies to information you have given us, and if we are processing your information based on your consent or performance of a contract. As our processing is mainly based on legitimate interests, it is unlikely that this right will be relevant. If it does apply, you have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us to another organisation, or give it to you.

## Data Sharing
* We will not share your information with any third parties for the purposes of direct marketing. We occasionally use data processors who are third parties and we have contracts in place with them. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct.
* In some circumstances we might be legally obliged to share information, for example under a court order or with statutory or regulatory bodies.In any scenario, we’ll satisfy ourselves that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information and document our decision making and satisfy ourselves we have a legal basis on which to share the information.
