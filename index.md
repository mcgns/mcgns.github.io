## Coronavirus

Here at the Middleton Cheney Good Neighbour Scheme the wellbeing of our volunteers and clients is our top priority. We are taking this unprecedented situation very seriously and giving updated advice to our volunteers, based on government and Public Health England advice, but also taking particular account of our clients' vulnerability.

Because of the need for social distancing we cannot currently help with tasks like gardening and help around the home.
